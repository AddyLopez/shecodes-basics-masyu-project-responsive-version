## Description

A minimally altered, responsive version of my Masyu app for display on my responsive coding portfolio website. The application is an interactive landing page for Masyu puzzles, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Click the button at the bottom to sign up for the fictional Masyu Daily Challenge!

Submitted as my final student project for SheCodes Basics coding workshop, this application was coded in my third week of learning how to code, with zero prior knowledge!

## Content & Design Features

- All text is original and written by me

- All images are original screenshots that illustrate the solving of the puzzle by me

- Original design with a card-like appearance, tasteful font (with a fallback font), and complementary, reversed color gradients for the background of the web page and the inset application. Wedding of form and content: the minimalist aesthetic of the app complements the minimalist aesthetic principles of the puzzles.

- Sign-up newsletter function accepts a range of inputs from the user across the spectrum of enthusiasm, including the inputs "yes," "yeah," "sure," "yep," "definitely," "totally," "hell yes," and "hell yeah," accounting for blank space (with the .trim() method) and for uppercase or lowercase letters
